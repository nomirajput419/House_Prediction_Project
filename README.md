House Sales Prediction Using ML
Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning models.
It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Multiple ML models tested (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Model performance evaluation with accuracy metrics

Dataset

The dataset contains details about houses (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location).

Target variable: House Sale Price

Technologies Used

Python 

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/nomirajput419/House_Sales_Prediction_Using_ML.git


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook / Python script to train and test models.
 Results

Best model achieved good accuracy in predicting house prices.

Visualizations provide insights into which features most affect house prices.
